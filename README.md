# us-food-deserts-harmonized-dataset

This repository provides a cleaned and harmonized food access dataset at the U.S. census tract level.

The dataset integrates multiple public data sources, including USDA Food Access Research Atlas indicators, U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) demographics, and food retail location data derived from OpenStreetMap and USDA SNAP retailer listings.

The goal of this project is to reduce the data preparation burden for researchers, analysts, and policymakers by offering a reproducible, well-documented dataset suitable for downstream analysis of food access, socioeconomic context, and geographic disparities.
